			<string>&lt;p&gt;Masonry is a light-weight layout framework which wraps AutoLayout with a nicer syntax.
Masonry has its own layout DSL which provides a chainable way of describing your
NSLayoutConstraints which results in layout code which is more concise and readable.
   Masonry supports iOS and Mac OSX.&lt;/p&gt;
